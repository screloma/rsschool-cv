3. Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
   I always seek for improvement, what matters to me the most is the sense of accomplishment when you do your best. I like to code and to get better in it.
4. Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)
   I have some knowledge in Python(automation, Telegram bots, site scraping), HTML/CSS+ReactJS and a pretty shallow knowledge of C++.
5. Code examples (LATEST)
6. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
   freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
   Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)
   My latest project was a PLO starting hands chart based on solver calculations written in React+Node.
7. Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)
8. English (elaborate on what kind of practice you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)
   Can't say i have any **actual** English expirience, but almost all content i consume on regular basis is in English: movies, books, video games, documentation.
